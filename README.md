# Hyper Homelab
This is a home lab environment based on the following technologies:
- Microsoft Hyper-V
- Oracle VM VirtualBox
- Vagrant
- Ansible

Ansible and Vagrant are always required on the host machine.

Hyper-V and VirtualBox are not fully interchangeable (due to virtual network differences). At least one needs to be installed on the host machine.
